.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an interface for exploring test suites, test cases and benchmarks. The
visitor type is used as an argument to all test suites. Test suites can
enumerate test cases and other test suites. It is a part of the implementation
and is not expected to be implemented by library users.
.Pp
.Nm zt_visitor_vtab
is an opaque type comprised of functions that define the interface. The
interface is only used internally so the implementation is private.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
Interface values combine an object pointer with a function table pointer and
are passed by value.
.Pp
An interface can use the NULL pointer as an object pointer if there is no need
to refer to any data specific to an instance. The function table pointer cannot
be null as it defines the unique aspect of the implementation.
