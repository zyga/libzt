Changes in 0.2:

 * Argument type to all unit test functions was typedef'd
   to zt_t, to abbreviate the boilerplate text and to avoid
   having to type struct zt_test.

 * The field zt_claim.verifier was renamed to zt_claim.make_verifier.
   There is no public API breakage on this as claims are not constructed
   by user code apart from the existing stable helpers.
